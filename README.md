Networking dubstep. We have a [theme song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OR6AV9yJPoM)!

Description
===========

So what the hell this? This is a layer for two very useful http libraries: [rest-client](https://github.com/archiloque/rest-client) and [mechanize](https://github.com/sparklemotion/mechanize). If you do any sort of web crawling, browsing, URL following and want to consolidate all your tools in one library, then this one's for you. And if you're serious about that stuff, you're probably using proxies. `DubDubDub` makes it easy to configure proxies for everything you do.

Install
=======

    gem install dubdubdub
